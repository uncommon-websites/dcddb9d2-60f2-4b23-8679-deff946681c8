    "prompt": "A diverse military family—parents and children of varying ages and backgrounds—in casual, everyday clothing, shopping together at a small local San Diego boutique. The family is captured mid-interaction, sharing a genuine moment of laughter and ease as they browse. The environment features subtle hints of Fleet Navy in clothing and Mission Green through potted plants or local produce, with warm, soft natural light filtering in through large windows.
