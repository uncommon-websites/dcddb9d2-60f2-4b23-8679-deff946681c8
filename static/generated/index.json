    "prompt": "A diverse military family—parents and children of varying ages and backgrounds—in casual, everyday clothing, shopping together at a small local San Diego boutique. The family is captured mid-interaction, sharing a genuine moment of laughter and ease as they browse. The environment features subtle hints of Fleet Navy in clothing and Mission Green through potted plants or local produce, with warm, soft natural light filtering in through large windows. The scene is framed to show the family as the focus, with San Diego’s neighborhood character visible through the storefront or architectural details. Expressions are relaxed and content, body language open and natural, conveying a sense of relief, belonging, and quiet satisfaction. The composition uses moderate negative space, shallow depth of field, and a candid, documentary style. No uniforms, no technology, no text, no staged patriotic symbols—just authentic, dignified connection in a modern, approachable San Diego setting.",
